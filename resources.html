  <h1>Resources Used</h1>
    <p>For the zoom/display text on hover I used
    <a href="http://geekgirllife.com/animate-text-over-images-on-hover-without-javascript/">this</a> tutorial</p>
    <p>I also used w3 school's tutorial javascript for my tabbing (I made a few minor changes though)</p>
    <p><a href="sources.txt">Here</a> is a .txt file with all of my image/video sources</p>
    <p>I created the "JBMR" main logo from scratch using photoshop.</p>
    <p>Genre selectors, movie selectors, and the back to homepage button use the CSS rollover effect</p>
    <p>I used javascript to 'tab' by movie reviews on the genre pages to keep most of the info on the page hidden until
      it is needed, <br> so when you click on a movie poster, it runs my 'openRev' function and displays the tabbed info</p>
    <p>Site Summary:
      <br> My website is a collection of movie reviews written by me, about movies that I've kinda randomly chosen from my library.
      <br> The homepage gives you a selection of genre boxes to choose from, that link to pages with 2-4 movie poster images
      <br> clicking on the poster expands an embedded youtube trailer and the review.
      <br> I did my best work on the hover effects on the genres and movies,
      <br> my review 'tabs', and I also think my logo is pretty dope.
      <br> If anything needs improvement I'd say number one is this resources page becasue it's vanilla as hell, but
      <br> I really don't care enough about this portion of the project to put more work into it. My second area with room
      <br> for improvement would be the way the movie posters are laid out. I want the list of movies to be centered on
      <br> the page, but that proved to be too diffcult to figure out for some reason. C'est la vie.
      <br> I made sure the site is easily navigatable on mobile through the use of large buttons and a media query
      <br> the media query decides whether to align the movies horizontally or vertically on the movie pages
      <br> and i got rid of the hover effects on the main page on mobile because they don't really work with touch screens
      <br> and just displayed my genre captions at the bottom of the box at all times.
